# Different strategies provenance vector selection (included weighted methods)

Some code was created during develep to choose correctly parameters and compare different strategies to select sampling points for provenance vector calulation.

* ./pv/pv_selection_weighted_ibs_sources.py
  
  Explores the generation of IBS samples through the use of environment points that generate the surface during its calculation. Code show images to user for a visual comparison between different strategies.

  **As input uses the files generated by ./ibs/info_generators/ibs_mesh_test_collision.py**

  Output:
  
  ![pv_selection_weighted_output2 ](./img/pv_selection_weighted_ibs_sources_1.png =600x)

* ./pv/pv_selection_weighted.py

  Iterates and generate images to show variations in selection of provenance vector given parameters as

  * rate_samples_in_ibs
  
    [int] proportions of samples which will be produced in the IBS surface.

    $$ N_{ibs} = RS_{ibs} * iT_{dimensions}$$

    where $N_{ibs}$ is the number of sample point to produce in the IBS surface, $iT_{dimensions}$ is the number of provenance vector in the interaction descriptor, and $RS_{ibs}$ is the parameter that varies the quantity of point to generate as IBS surfaces samples.

  * rate_generated_random_numbers

    [int] helps to establish the number of random numbers to be generated. This generator follows the Probability Density Function generated trough the IBS sampled points and their distances to the environment surfaces

  Output:

    ![pv_selection_weighted_output ](img/pv_selection_weighted_1.png =600x)
    ![pv_selection_weighted_output2 ](img/pv_selection_weighted_2.png =600x)
